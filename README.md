# backup-aviatrix-dnat-rules
Script to backup all DNAT rules from all Aviatrix gateways.
Remember that this is a script adapted for a specific need, with some exceptions such as removing gateways that contain "firenet" or "ingress" as part of the name. Feel free to copy and adapt the script as needed.
